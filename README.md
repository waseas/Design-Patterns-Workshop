# Design_Patterns
These are some of the design patters I studied as part of my Summer 2020 Design Patterns workshop.

## Adapter Pattern
Adapter Pattern is a Structural Pattern in GoF Design Patterns Book
It is used when a client class has to use another class (adaptee) that it cannot recognize. This unfamiliar class is wrapped inside another class (adapter), and enables the client to use the functionality of the adaptee.</br>

## Command Pattern
Command Pattern falls under the Behavioral Design Pattern.
The command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting us parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.</br>

## Factory Design Pattern
Factory Design Pattern falls under the creational design pattern. 
It is one of the most commonly used design pattern. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.</br>

## Singleton Design Pattern
Singleton design pattern falls under the creational design pattern category.
This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created. This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class. </br>

## State Design Pattern
State Design Pattern falls under the Behaiour Pattern.
In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes. </br>

## Decorator Design Pattern
Decorator Design Pattern falls under the structural Pattern.
This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
